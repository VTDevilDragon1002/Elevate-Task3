🔵 1. What Is Networking?
Networking is the process of connecting computers, mobile phones, routers, servers, and other devices so they can:
•	Share data
•	Access the internet
•	Communicate with each other
•	Transfer files
•	Use online services
Every device connected to a network needs:
•	An IP address (identity)
•	A MAC address (hardware ID)
•	A gateway (router)
•	A DNS server (website to IP converter)

🔵 2. Network Components (Full Explanation)
2.1 IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)
An IP address is like the “home address” of a device on a network.
Types of IP:
🚀 Private IP (Inside home/college)
•	Cannot access internet directly
•	Example:
o	192.168.0.5
o	10.0.0.19
🌐 Public IP (Provided by ISP)
•	Identifies you on the internet
•	Example:
o	103.54.98.22
IPv4 Example:
192.168.1.20
IPv6 Example:
2401:4900:cac4:a1b2:ef56:e5f0:6219:1118
________________________________________
2.2 MAC Address
MAC = Media Access Control
It is a 48-bit hardware address burned into your network card.
Example:
08:00:27:1F:B7:23
Purpose:
•	Identifies device inside local network
•	Used for ARP
•	Helps switches deliver packets correctly
2.3 DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS converts:
Domain name → IP address
Why needed?
Because humans remember words, computers use numbers.
Example:
google.com → 142.251.43.238
Types of DNS Records:
•	A record – IPv4
•	AAAA record – IPv6
•	CNAME – Alias
•	MX – Mail server
•	TXT – Verification records
When you enter google.com:
1.	Browser → DNS Resolver
2.	Resolver → Root Server
3.	Root → TLD (.com)
4.	TLD → Authoritative Server
5.	IP returned to you

2.4 TCP vs UDP (FULL DETAIL)
🔵 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
•	Connection-oriented
•	Reliable
•	Slow (handshake required)
•	Ordered delivery
•	Guaranteed delivery
Used in:
•	HTTP
•	HTTPS
•	SSH
•	FTP
•	Email
🔴 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
•	Connectionless
•	Fast
•	Lightweight
•	No guarantee
•	No order
Used in:
•	DNS
•	Online games
•	Video calls
•	Streaming

🔵 3. HOW DATA TRAVELS IN A NETWORK (COMPLETE FLOW)
When you open google.com:
1.	Browser checks cache
2.	Sends DNS Query
3.	DNS Server replies with IP
4.	Browser starts TCP Handshake
5.	Sends HTTP/HTTPS Request
6.	Server sends Response
7.	Data is shown in browser
Wireshark can see all of this.

🟢 4. INSTALLING WIRESHARK IN KALI LINUX
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireshark -y
Enable capturing without root:
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
Restart:
reboot
________________________________________
🟢 5. FIXING INTERNET (WHY IMPORTANT)
Your VM had:
❌ IPv6 issues
✔ IPv4 working after fix
Commands you used:
echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
This ensures:
✔ DNS
✔ Browsing
✔ Packet capturing
✔ Ping
work correctly.

🟢 6. WIRESHARK COMPLETE PRACTICAL WORK (FULL DETAIL)
✔ Step 1 — Open Wireshark
wireshark
Select:
👉 eth0
👉 Start Capture
You will see packets like:
•	ARP
•	ICMP
•	TLS
•	TCP
•	DNS

⭐ 7. TCP THREE-WAY HANDSHAKE — DETAILED
Filter:
tcp.flags.syn==1
Open Firefox → Go to:
http://example.com
You will see:
1. SYN (Client → Server)
Meaning:
“Hello server, I want to connect.”
2. SYN, ACK (Server → Client)
Meaning:
“Okay client, I accept.”
3. ACK (Client → Server)
Meaning:
“Connection confirmed.”
This makes TCP reliable, orderly, secure.

⭐ 8. DNS QUERY ANALYSIS — FULL DETAIL
Filter:
dns
Visit:
google.com
You will see:
Standard Query A google.com
•	Asking for IPv4
Standard Query Response
•	DNS server returns actual IP
This shows:
✔ DNS is working
✔ Domain resolution is successful
________________________________________
⭐ 9. HTTP PACKET ANALYSIS (FULL DETAIL)
Filter:
http
Visit:
http://example.com
You will see plain text:
•	HTTP GET
•	Host header
•	Server header
•	HTML response
Reason:
HTTP is NOT encrypted.
Anyone in the network can read your traffic.
________________________________________
⭐ 10. HTTPS PACKET ANALYSIS (FULL DETAIL)
Filter:
tls
Visit:
https://facebook.com
You will see:
•	Client Hello
•	Server Hello
•	Certificate
•	Encrypted Application Data
You CANNOT see:
❌ Password
❌ Message content
❌ Cookies
Because HTTPS uses TLS encryption.
________________________________________
⭐ 11. ARP PACKET ANALYSIS
ARP = Address Resolution Protocol
Converts:
IP → MAC
Example:
Who has 10.155.67.1? Tell 10.155.67.40
This shows:
•	Your VM trying to find gateway
•	Router replying with MAC address

⭐ 12. SAVE PCAP FILE
File → Save As → task3_capture.pcapng
